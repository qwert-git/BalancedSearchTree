# Balanced Search Tree
Binary search tree is a data structure that quickly allows us to maintain a sorted list of numbers.

It is called a binary tree because each tree node has a maximum of two children.
It is called a search tree because it can be used to search for the presence of a number in O(log(n)) time.
The properties that separate a binary search tree from a regular binary tree is

All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node
All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node
Both subtrees of each node are also BSTs i.e. they have the above two properties

# Counting Sort
As its name implies, counting sort works by counting the number of occurrences of each distinct element in the list. An auxiliary array stores these occurrences and maps the values of the distinct elements with the indices of the array. Finally, the algorithm iterates over the auxiliary array while sorting the original array.

The algorithm is not well-suited for collections with a large range of values because the algorithmâ€™s efficiency decreases as the range of values increases. 

### Average-Case Time Complexity
Counting sort encounters the average-case time complexity scenario when we select random values e.g. from 1 to n. In this case, assuming we have an array of size n and the value of the largest element being k, the algorithm has O(n+k) as its average-case time complexity.
